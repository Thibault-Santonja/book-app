Book App
===

The purpose of this project is to create a quick book collection mobile app :
1. Read a barcode
2. Find the corresponding book
3. Add it to your numerical library
4. Make fun with your library:
  1. Share it
  2. Organize it
  3. Create booklist
  4. Create wishlist (books found at a retailer that you would like)
  5. Review your books

> It can be interesting to link it with Notion to publish your reviews / lists
